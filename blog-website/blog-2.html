                    <p class="text paragraph">Born on November 7, 1913 in the city of Algiers, Algeria, Albert Camus
                        was raised in a poor working family dominated by a stern grandmother. He
                        never knew his father who died on the battlefield in 1914, at the beginning
                        of WWI. His cherished mother was half deaf and illiterate. Throughout his
                        life he would maintain an exceptionally close contact with her that went
                        beyond the usual filial connection. He and his brother Lucien lived in an
                        extended family, which an uncle had also joined, in a modest apartment
                        located in one of Algiers' working districts. Thanks to the close attention
                        paid by his grammar and high school teachers and against all odds, he was
                        able to study and obtain, in 1935, a graduate degree in philosophy at the
                        University of Algiers with an ambitious thesis entitled Christian Metaphysics
                        and Neoplatonism. His hypersensitive cultural and political antennas led
                        him to join the Communist party, which promptly threw him out in 1937
                        after he had uttered growing reservations concerning some of the party's
                        ideological framework and his criticism of its local and international implementations.</p>

                    <p class="text paragraph">Albert Camus, the renowned French writer, had a diverse and politically engaged life during the 1930s. He explored a wide range of interests, immersing himself in the works of French classics and contemporary writers, including André Gide, Henry de Montherlant, and André Malraux. He actively participated in the intellectual circles of Algiers, especially among the young left-wing intellectuals. During a brief period in 1934-35, Camus was even a member of the Algerian Communist Party. His involvement extended to the theater, where he wrote, produced, adapted, and acted in plays for the Théâtre du Travail (Workers’ Theatre), which aimed to bring high-quality theater to working-class audiences. This enduring love for the theater persisted throughout his life, despite his plays being the least-admired part of his literary work. Nevertheless, "Le Malentendu" (Cross Purpose) and "Caligula" stand as landmarks in the Theatre of the Absurd, and his adaptations of William Faulkner’s "Requiem for a Nun" and Fyodor Dostoyevsky’s "The Possessed" left an indelible mark on the theatrical world.</p>

                <div class="col-4">
                    <p class="text paragraph">In the years leading up to World War II, Camus honed his skills as a journalist, working for "Alger-Républicain" in various roles, including leader-writer, subeditor, political reporter, and book reviewer. His articles analyzing social conditions among Muslims in the Kabylie region garnered attention for the injustices that would later contribute to the Algerian War, though this was 15 years in advance. Camus consistently advocated for humanitarian values and foresaw a future role for France in Algeria that would address colonialist injustices. His stance was rooted in principles of justice and morality, rather than ideological positions.</p>

                    <p class="text paragraph">In summary, Albert Camus led a multifaceted life in the 1930s, embracing literature, journalism, politics, and theater. His career as a journalist, particularly during and after the war, brought attention to issues of justice and morality. His literary works, including "The Stranger," "The Myth of Sisyphus," and "The Plague," explored themes of alienation, absurdity, and rebellion, leaving a lasting impact on the world of literature and philosophy.</p>

                <div class="col-4">
                    <p class="text paragraph">Camus gained significant influence as a journalist during the occupation of France and the immediate post-Liberation period. He edited "Combat," a Parisian daily that continued the work of a Resistance newspaper largely orchestrated by Camus himself. His position was characterized by an independent left-wing perspective, grounded in ideals of justice and truth. He believed that all political action should be morally grounded. However, as the Left and Right increasingly embraced expedient approaches, Camus grew disillusioned and severed his ties with "Combat" in 1947.</p>

                <div class="col-5">
                    <p class="text paragraph">By this time, Camus had become a prominent literary figure. His first novel, "L’Étranger" (The Stranger), published in 1942, explored the theme of 20th-century alienation through the story of an "outsider" sentenced to death for his refusal to conform to societal norms. In 1942, Camus also published the influential philosophical essay "Le Mythe de Sisyphe" (The Myth of Sisyphus), where he sympathetically examined contemporary nihilism and the "absurd." He began seeking a way to transcend nihilism, a quest that led to his second novel, "La Peste" (The Plague) in 1947. This work symbolically portrayed the battle against an epidemic in Oran and emphasized the importance of human dignity and fraternity in the face of adversity. Camus transitioned from his initial focus on the absurd to the concept of moral and metaphysical "rebellion." He explored this idea further in "L’Homme révolté" (The Rebel) in 1951, provoking criticism from Marxist and near-Marxist theorists, such as Jean-Paul Sartre. His other significant literary works include the technically brilliant novel "La Chute" (The Fall) in 1956 and a collection of short stories titled "L’Exil et le royaume" (Exile and the Kingdom) in 1957. "La Chute" delves into Christian symbolism and satirically exposes complacent forms of secular humanist morality.

                    <p class="text paragraph">Albert Camus and Jean-Paul Sartre, prominent existentialist philosophers and literary figures in 20th-century France, shared a complex and, at times, tumultuous relationship. Initially, they were philosophical allies, both champions of existentialism, a movement that emphasized individual freedom and the creation of personal meaning in a seemingly absurd world. They collaborated and even co-founded the journal "Les Temps modernes." Their early camaraderie was rooted in a shared commitment to existentialist principles and a shared vision of the human condition.</p>

                <div class="col-5">
                    <p class="text paragraph">However, this intellectual partnership eventually soured due to profound political and philosophical disagreements. Sartre was deeply engaged in leftist politics and embraced Marxism, while Camus maintained political independence and criticized aspects of Marxism. Their philosophical perspectives diverged as well, with Camus exploring a stoic humanism and the search for meaning in the face of absurdity, while Sartre's existentialism asserted that existence precedes essence. These differences led to a public falling out and a lasting rift in their relationship, symbolizing the complex landscape of post-war French intellectual thought.</p>

                    <p class="text paragraph">As novelist and playwright, moralist and political theorist, Albert Camus after World War II became the spokesman of his own generation and the mentor of the next, not only in France but also in Europe and eventually the world. His writings, which addressed themselves mainly to the isolation of man in an alien universe, the estrangement of the individual from himself, the problem of evil, and the pressing finality of death, accurately reflected the alienation and disillusionment of the postwar intellectual. He is remembered, with Sartre, as a leading practitioner of the existential novel. Though he understood the nihilism of many of his contemporaries, Camus also argued the necessity of defending such values as truth, moderation, and justice. In his last works he sketched the outlines of a liberal humanism that rejected the dogmatic aspects of both Christianity and Marxism.</p>
